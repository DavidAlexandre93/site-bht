Our focus is on creating an inclusive community, valuing both competitive and casual gaming. We were born with the purpose of being a community/organization to share strategies, experiences, and above all, the passion for Call of Duty. We are always open to new members who want to contribute to our growing family, offering a welcoming environment for everyone. With plans to expand our horizons to other games in the future, BloodHunts Gaming is committed to being more than an organization: we are a community, a family, united by our love for games."
